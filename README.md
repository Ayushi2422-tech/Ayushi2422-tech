Hello!
I am Ayushi Tyagi, an undergraduate, pursuing Btech in ECE from Ajay Kumar Garg Engineering College, Ghaziabad.

I am passionate about my work. Because I love what I do.
Back in 2019, I started working as a freelancer on Upwork where I did some jobs of article writing, video scriptwriting, web content writing, etc, where my passion led me to challenge myself daily and learn new skills that helped me to do better work. For example, I taught myself how to use Wix to showcase my skills in designing and content writing. I soon became the go-to person for any content needs.

Currently, I am working to build my own brand under the name Chic Collections Noida. It is a self started family business dealing in women's ethnic and casual wear. With today's ever-changing requirement of designer clothes, you may struggle to find the best look for yourself. From ethnic wear to casual, or an elegant look for your professional lifestyle, we have a wide variety of designer products for the ladies and girls out there.

Please view the links below and connect with us to grab trendy women's wear:
